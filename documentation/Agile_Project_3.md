# Agile Story Points
We apply the [Agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development) method of time keeping to track how much work we should be putting in.

<summary>Story Points</summary>

- **Hello World:** Everyone's first program.
- **FizzBuzz:** If-Statements in Javascript.
- **Grid:** Taking input and printing an i*j grid.
- **Loops:** For, while, do-while loop basics.
- **2D Arrays:** Array in an array!
- **Taco Shop Code:** Arithmatic and input creates your lunch bill.
- **Tab Panel:** Implementing buttons in HTML
- **Data Sets:** Custom data structure called set.
- **Shape Classes:** Intro to object-oriented programming.
- `(baseline)` **DMV:** Reading an input file and checking its values.
- **Board Games:** Simple games and a menu system.
- **Shape Container:** Custom classes for calculating shape areas.
- **Browser:** Linked list basics.
- **Elevator:** Fun with Queues!
- **Maze:** Recursion helps us solve a maze.
- **Sorts:** Recursion sorting methods, along with timed graphing.
- **Binary Search Tree:** The most confusing of the data structures.
- **Cooking with Engineers(Project 3):** Input ingredients to find recipes to make
- **Battleship:** Project 1 implementation of the battleship game.
- **Battleship With AI:** Battleship with AI and big shot

## Time Tracking with Story Points

| -- 1 -- | -- 2 -- | -- 3 -- | -- 5 -- | -- 8 -- | -- 13 -- |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| "Hello world"	| Loops	| Data sets	| DMV | Browser |	Sorts |
| FizzBuzz | 2D Arrays | Shapes | Classes | Board Games | Elevator | Binary Search Tree |
| Grid | Taco Shop Code | Tab Panel | Shape Container | Maze | Battleship |
|  |  |  |  |  | Cooking with Engineers |
|  |  |  |  |  | Battleship With AI | 

So, we estimated our **Project 3** cooking with engineers to be **13** story points.

We estimated from our previous labs and projects that **1 story point** is equivalent to **3 hours**. We put out all the time period that we took for each one of the projects and labs that we have mentioned above and then decided that one story point would be equivalent to 3 hours.

Therefore our total number of estimated hours for project 2 is **39 hours**!
